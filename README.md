# SurveyApe

> Team project for Graduate software engineering course Enterprise Application Development.

## Goal

* The goal is to build a distributed enterprise web application which enables the user to become surveyor and surveyee. User can login and create surveys as a surveyor and ask others to provide their response. Surveyee does not have to be registered to participate in survey and can provide survey response.

* We were tasked with this project requirement so that we can learn and develop REST API enterprise application. 

## Introduction

* User can be surveyee and surveyor
* 3 types of survey in terms of their accessibility: 
	* General: Accessible by anyone 
	* Open: Accessible by invited user
	* Closed: Accessible by invited and registered user only
* Applications supports following questions types in survey:
	* Multiple choice questions 
		- Choice type
			- Text only: all choices are given as text.
			- Image only: every choice is given as an image.
		- Answer type:
			- Dropdownlist (Single selection only)
			- Radio button (Single selection only)
			- Checkbox (Single & multiple selection)
	* Yes/no questions. 
	* Short answer questions, where the answer is plain text.
	* Date/time questions, which allow the surveyee to pick a Date and/or Time as the answer
	* Star rating questions, which allow surveyees to rank a variable using 0-5 stars
* Surveyor can visualize statistics of survey for each question in dashboard
* Surveyor can export created survey and import multiple questions from any survey
